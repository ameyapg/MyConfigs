1. Pathogen ( Plugin manager )
2. Syntastic ( Syntax checker ) -- Just stopped working for some reason..was could have been really helpful otherwise
3. NERDTREE ( File browser - best plugin ever)(since it does not work well at 'work', enable keymaps only for 'play')
4. Omnicppcomplete ( Needs Ctags database....need to find a good way to generate that over a large database)
5. Also added the stl.vim plugin for better C++ syntax highlighting
